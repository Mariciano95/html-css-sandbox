   <h2 class="section__title">LEARN ABOUT RADON</h2>
   <h3 class="section__subtitle">Radon is 
    a cancer-causing, radioactive gas</h3>
   <p class="section__paragraph">You can't see radon. 
    You can't smell radon. You can't taste radon. 
    But radon may be a problem in your home. 
    Radon causes thousands of deaths each year.
    The Surgeon General has warned that radon 
    is the second leading cause of lung cancer in 
    the United States. Only smoking causes more lung 
    cancer deaths.</p>

    <h3 class="section__subtitle">Radon can be found 
        all over the U.S.</h3>
    <p class="section__paragraph">Radon comes from the 
    natural (radioactive) breakdown of uranium in soil, rock, 
    and water and gets into the air you breathe.
    Radon can be found all over the U.S. and can 
    get into any type of building â€” homes, offices,
    and schools. You and your family are most likely
    to get your greatest exposure at home, where you 
    spend most of your time.</p>

    <h3 class="section__subtitle">You should test for radon</h3>
    <p class="section__paragraph">Testing is the only way to know
    if you and your family are at risk from radon. The EPA and
    the Surgeon General recommend testing all homes. Testing
    is inexpensive and easy. It will only take a few minutes
    of your time.</p>

    <h3 class="section__subtitle">You can fix a radon problem</h3>
    <p class="section__paragraph">Radon reduction systems work
    and they are not too costly.
    Some radon reduction systems 
    can reduce radon levels in your home
    by up to 99%. Even very high levels can be 
    reduced to acceptable levels.</p>

    <h3 class="section__subtitle">How does radon get into your home?</h3>
    <p class="section__paragraph">Radon is a radioactive gas. It comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build up. Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes, and homes with or without basements.</p>
